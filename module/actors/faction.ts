If a rival has stealthed assets on a world, they cannot be targeted for an attack until they`ve been discovered by a faction`s intelligence agents. Attacks can only be launched against assets on the same world as the attacker. To launch an attack, the attacker selects one or more of their own assets and targets a rival faction with assets on the same world. One at a time, each attacking asset is matched against a defending asset chosen by the defender. Each attacking asset can attack only once per turn, though a defending asset can defend as many times as the defender wishes, assuming it can survive multiple conflicts. Once matched, the attacker rolls 1d10 and adds the relevant attribute for the asset. For example, a military unit`s Attack might add the faction`s Force rating to the attack roll, while a cyberninja unit might add the faction`s Cunning to the attack roll. The defender then rolls 1d10 and adds the attribute that the attack targets. In the instance of the military unit, this might be an attack against Force, causing the defender to add their Force rating to the roll, while defending against the cyberninjas might require adding the defender`s Cunning rating. The Attack line of the attacking asset indicates which attribute to add to the attack roll and which to add to the defense roll. If the attacker`s roll exceeds the defender`s roll, the attack is a success. The defending asset suffers damage as given on the Attack line of the attacking asset. If the defender has a Base of Influence on the world, the defender may opt to let the damage bypass the asset and hit the Base of Influence instead, causing damage to it and the faction hit points. If the asset or Base of Influence is reduced to zero hit points, it is lost. If the attacker`s roll is less than the defender`s roll, the attack fails. The defending asset can apply whatever damage their Counterattack line indicates to the attacking asset. If the defending asset has no Counterattack line, the attacker suffers no consequences for the failed attack. A tie on the roll results in both Attack and Counterattack succeeding.

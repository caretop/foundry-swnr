A vacc suit oxygen tank weighs 1 encumbrance, included with the weight of the suit, and functions for six hours. Vacc suits are cumbersome, and apply a -2 penalty to all hit rolls and skill checks that require movement. Those with at least a month of zero-gee experience can ignore this penalty. No armor can be worn with a vacc suit, though the suit itself grants AC 13 to its wearers. A vacc suit requires one type A power cell for each twelve hours of operation. Vacc suits have a self-healing exterior that can seal the puncture wounds caused by bullets, arrows, or energy beams, but a strike from an edged weapon can overwhelm the repair system. If a character with 10 or fewer hit points is struck by an edged weapon, there is a 50% chance the suit is torn.

While useless in conventional ship-to-ship combat, the array can deflect or dampen meteor impacts, dropped penetrator rods, or other non-powered bombardment techniques, and the snuffer field is powerful enough to prevent nuclear fission reactions over a hemisphere-sized area. A single ship with a PDA can protect against any natural meteor strikes and deny easy terror bombardment of a planet's population. The PDA cannot fully protect against orbital strike by powered penetrators, but it can nudge them off course and make pinpoint strikes impractical.

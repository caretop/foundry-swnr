If the world is devoid of human inhabitants, replace the features with alien relics or the remnants of scouts or lost colonies.\n\nThe tables below provide a suggested time of day and initial distance for the encounter, but these baselines will vary depending on the choices and capabilities of the PCs. Some encounters are unlikely to occur at night, unless the parties involved are traveling or otherwise active despite the dark. Suggestions are given for likely-hostile and likely-friendly creatures, but a reaction roll will influence attitudes greatly.","displayRoll":true,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"RollTable.cwrQx1vn2LUjVXRX"}},"folder":null,"formula":"1d1","img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","name":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters","permission":{"P3lRTKxUBvk8Gei6":3,"default":0},"replacement":true,"results":[{"_id":"HKHQFNWLC2EG3eRf","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"uQH3AOSTleJY4JUe","text":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters - Weather and Lighting","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"RopoQoPZjEMVCeZN","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"VR1bkv4Psm3Huhos","text":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters - Basic Nature of the Encounter","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"uJvll9c0EuT6liV9","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"s3KZrzV3qYchuGBg","text":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters - Types of Friendly Creatures","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"SjK7oDdnAhFT8D09","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"zIw21r3Wn6gpFCsP","text":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters - Initial Encounter Range","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"lNkwHciKCDIzCOXu","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"dcRklF6JMDVNxlfz","text":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters - Types of Hostile Creatures","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"eAdknTQhi0wd2wXm","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"F02ylWSwz48YjPAy","text":"One Roll Wilderness Encounters - Specific Nearby Feature of Relevance","type":2,"weight":1}],"sort":0}

In conjunction with the adjacent one-roll NPC tables, you can use the tools below to quickly generate a patron and what it is they want from the party.\n\nOne particularly convenient technique is to have a few short filler adventures drawn up as described on page 177, and then when the players suddenly need a job or need a favor that only a cooperative patron could provide, use the patron to hook them up with the filler adventure. If you lack a convenient premade adventure, it’s usually most practical to have the patron request some simple, direct, one-scene job that you feel comfortable in running on the fly. You can consult page 178 to find appropriate pay rates for different patrons.","displayRoll":true,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"RollTable.9Q1n3NOe3AVlquiW"}},"folder":null,"formula":"1d1","img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","name":"One Roll Patrons","permission":{"P3lRTKxUBvk8Gei6":3,"default":0},"replacement":true,"results":[{"_id":"B4XjZiGvd5xtWamp","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"9x8xoivdKBJ4lvyW","text":"One Roll Patrons - Trustworthiness","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"6DEKfjXR136RKIVo","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"87UAC08zH0ZEwkbk","text":"One Roll Patrons - Basic Challenge of the Job","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"OTWzk1vTzPjCpszk","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"AbwkDHmMs8vRJK4Q","text":"One Roll Patrons - Main Countervailing Force","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"tC8JxaTChnysBIX8","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"p2WhakZgxW9o9y5w","text":"One Roll Patrons - Eagerness to Hire","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"RNjRrV9KO2h6Zx4R","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"Aby6eSItRpxbz3te","text":"One Roll Patrons - Potential Non-Cash Rewards","type":2,"weight":1},{"_id":"vYR6s9wy4lBV9nBW","collection":"swnr.one-roll-backing","drawn":false,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","range":[1,1],"rangeH":1,"rangeL":1,"resultId":"3zQc8EovhkMSlNUE","text":"One Roll Patrons - Complication to the Job","type":2,"weight":1}],"sort":0}

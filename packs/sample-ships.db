The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.  The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it is only a single ship… a single, extremely expensive ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time, and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it."},"img":"systems/swnr/assets/icons/spaceship.png","items":[{"name":"Vortex Tunnel Inductor","type":"shipWeapon","img":"systems/swnr/assets/icons/game-icons.net/item-icons/sinusoidal-beam.svg","data":{"broken":false,"cost":5000000,"costMultiplier":false,"damage":"3d20","description":"A capital-class model of the SIP, a VTI is capable pf incapacitating a cruiser in two hits.

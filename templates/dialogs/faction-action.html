      The following list of actions includes the most common activities a faction might choose to perform. The GM should
      feel free to add new action types, or allow alternate choices if a faction wishes to do something that doesnâ€™t
      quite fit the list below. As a rule, a faction should only be able to do one thing per turn, but should be able to
      do that same thing with any or all assets.<br><br>
